# Jekyll-Test
This is a test Jekyll project

For the impatient, here’s how to get a boilerplate Jekyll site up and running.

~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000

If you wish to install jekyll into the current directory, you can do so by alternatively running jekyll new .
instead of a new directory name. That’s nothing, though. The real magic happens when you start 
creating blog posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all
the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.
